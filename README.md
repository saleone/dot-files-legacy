# GNU/Linux config files (dot files)

Dump of old GNU/Linux configuration files. 
These include:
* `mpd` & `ncmpcpp` setup for playing music
* `Conky` setup that displays a lot of unecessary data on the screen (but it looks badass)
* `devilspie2` setup to integrate `ncmpcpp` on the desktop (via undecorated terminal window)
* All kinds of shell setups that I've tried
* Memories of days wasted customizing `openbox`, `xfce` and any customizable DE
